      <p>This Modern Dark Invoice Template blends a bold, professional appearance with sleek usability, ideal for businesses, freelancers, and consultants who want to leave a lasting impression. Designed with a rich dark theme (#2C2C2C) and accented by a vibrant orange gradient header (#FFB07A to #FFA07A), this template conveys sophistication while maintaining readability and structure.

The top section includes a large invoice title, a dynamic circular logo box, and detailed organization information with clean alignment. The gradient header gives a powerful visual punch while preserving clarity and contrast. The invoice body features a split layout with customer billing information on the left and invoice metadata (invoice number, date, due date) neatly aligned on the right.

A responsive itemized table allows you to list all billed products or services, complete with quantity, unit price, and total. The table uses high-contrast rows and columns for legibility, even in low-light or screen-based environments. Totals are elegantly presented in a separate section with emphasis on the final amount, making financial summaries crystal clear.

The bottom section provides detailed payment instructions, including account name, number, bank, and custom notes. A subtle corner decoration adds a final stylistic touch, making this template perfect for both digital delivery and high-quality prints.</p>
