      <p>The Invoice Template is a bold and modern billing solution designed for creative professionals, studios, and service-based businesses that value both functionality and visual appeal. Featuring a clean layout with a distinctive logo circle and vibrant rainbow footer bar, this template adds personality and style to your invoicing process while maintaining a professional tone.

A full-width itemized table clearly displays quantity, unit price, CGST, SGST, and total cost per line item, making it perfect for businesses that handle tax-inclusive billing. The totals section is neatly aligned and highlights grand totals both numerically and in words for added clarity.

With responsive spacing, sharp contrast, and a dark-themed footer, the StudioStar template is optimized for both print and digital use. It includes placeholders for essential billing details, payment methods, and thank-you notesâ€”perfect for customizing to suit any brand identity.

Whether you're a freelance designer, digital agency, or production company, the StudioStar Invoice Template blends style and precision to help you leave a lasting impression on clients.</p>
