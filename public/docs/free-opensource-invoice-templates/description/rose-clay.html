        <h4>Elegant Pink-Themed Invoice Template</h4><br>
This beautifully crafted HTML invoice template features a soft, pastel pink theme designed to reflect elegance and professionalism. With clean typography, balanced spacing, and a visually appealing layout, this template is ideal for modern businesses, freelancers, and boutique service providers who want to deliver a refined client experience.

The template includes all essential billing elementsâ€”company branding with logo, invoice metadata (number, issue date, due date), client and organization details, itemized charges with tax columns (CGST/SGST), and calculated totals including discounts and round-off values. A sleek signature area adds a personalized touch, while the thank-you note reinforces customer appreciation.

Responsive and print-ready, this invoice is fully customizable using placeholders such as [[org_name]], [[customer_name]], [[grand_total]], and more, making it suitable for automated invoicing systems.</p>
