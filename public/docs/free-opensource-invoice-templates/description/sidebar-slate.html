        <h4>Modern Split-View Invoice Template with Payment Sidebar</h4><br>

This modern split-view invoice template is a stylish and professional HTML design tailored for freelancers, agencies, and businesses that want to present billing details with clarity and elegance. It features a two-column layout—a dedicated sidebar for recipient and payment information, and a main content area for invoice breakdown and totals.

On the left, the sidebar includes a company logo, recipient (client) information, and detailed payment instructions, including bank account details and PayPal address. It ends with a friendly “Thanks for your business” message, reinforcing professionalism and trust.

The main section on the right highlights your organization’s name, contact info, and the invoice metadata like Invoice Number, Date, and Due Date. It includes a well-structured item table.</p>
