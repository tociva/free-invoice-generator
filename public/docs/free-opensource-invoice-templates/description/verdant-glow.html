        <h4>Modern Teal-Inspired Invoice Template with Clean Layout and Tax Breakdown</h4><br>

This modern invoice template features a professional design with a calming teal color palette, creating a sleek and trustworthy feel perfect for business branding. Built using clean HTML and CSS, it is fully responsive and visually appealing on all screen sizes, thanks to a flexible layout and media-friendly font selection (Poppins from Google Fonts).

The layout begins with a bold header showcasing your logo and the invoice title prominently. Following this is a structured information section divided into three intuitive columns: sender details, recipient details, and invoice metadata (number, issue date, due date).

The core of the template is a fully styled table that lists items with quantity, price, CGST, SGST, and total. Alternating row colors improve readability, while right-aligned numeric data helps users scan totals quickly.

To enhance clarity and professionalism, the template includes a totals summary box with fields like Item Total, Discount, Subtotal, Tax, Round Off, and Grand Total â€” each visually grouped and styled with balance and hierarchy in mind.

The footer provides a polite closing message, enhancing customer satisfaction and encouraging repeat business. The template uses placeholder tags (e.g., [[customer_name]], [[item_amount]], etc.), making it easy to integrate into automated invoicing systems or dynamic web applications.

This invoice design is ideal for freelancers, agencies, and businesses that want to deliver a clear, branded, and professional billing experience. It is especially suited for organizations that include GST components in their pricing structure.</p>
