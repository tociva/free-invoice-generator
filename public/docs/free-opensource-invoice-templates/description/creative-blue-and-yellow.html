      <p>The Modern Invoice Template adopts a contemporary, structured layout with a bold vertical sidebar on the left, making it especially useful for businesses aiming to combine branding and clarity. The left panel features a dark navy background (#002b5b) with white text, creating a strong contrast that enhances visual hierarchy. It contains the company logo, invoice title, invoice number, issue date, and due date — all organized neatly for quick reference.

On the right, the main content area uses a spacious, clean white layout. Billing details are presented in a two-column format: one for the issuer and one for the recipient. This clearly distinguishes sender and recipient details, making the document easy to scan.

The itemized section uses a light grey background for headers and clean borders between rows. All numeric values, including quantities, unit prices, and totals, are right-aligned for readability. Below the table, the totals section includes a breakdown of costs — from item total and discount to tax and round-off — culminating in a bolded Grand Total. The total in words is also displayed in an italicized format to help avoid confusion over large numbers.

This template is especially effective for tech companies, professional services, or startups that want a modern, polished look with strong brand representation.</p>
