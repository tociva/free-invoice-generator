        <h4>Vibrant Purple & Green Invoice Template – Creative & Eye-Catching for Modern Brands</h4><br>

The Purple & Green Invoice Template combines bold color choices with a clean layout to deliver a vibrant and professional billing experience. This template is designed for creative agencies, freelancers, or modern businesses looking to stand out while maintaining clarity and professionalism in their invoicing.

The top section features a dual-pane layout with your company logo, client details, and invoice metadata such as invoice number, date, and due date — all framed within a rich purple background. The bright green accent adds contrast and highlights key elements like headings and totals, guiding the reader’s attention effectively.

At the center is a fully responsive itemized table with alternating row highlights, making it easy to view quantities, pricing, and totals. The light-colored table on a purple backdrop creates a fresh and energetic feel without sacrificing readability.

Below the table, a split panel layout shows payment methods on the left — perfect for card or bank details — and a clear summary of the invoice totals on the right, including subtotal, tax, and grand total. All data fields are dynamically customizable using placeholders like [[item_name]], [[grand_total]], and [[account_number]].

The footer wraps up the document with space for organization details and social media icons, enhancing brand presence and customer trust. This invoice template is ideal for businesses aiming for a balance of creativity, modern design, and practical structure. It’s fully printable and easy to adapt for digital use.</p>
