      <p>The Healthcare Invoice â€“ Minimalist Template is a clean, professional invoice layout tailored for the healthcare industry. It uses a calming blue color palette (#1976d2) that reflects trust and reliability, ideal for hospitals, clinics, and medical service providers. The design emphasizes clarity and simplicity, starting with a centered header that includes a logo and organization name. A bold blue line separates the header from the main content, providing visual structure.

The layout is divided into two key info sections: "Bill To" on the left and "Invoice Details" on the right, enabling quick access to patient and invoice-specific data. An itemized table follows, listing services or items with quantity, unit price, and total amount, all clearly separated with borders and styled for easy scanning. Totals are calculated and displayed beneath the table, showing the subtotal, tax, and grand total.

A bold "Total Due" bar stands out with a soft blue background, reinforcing the amount owed. At the bottom, the footer contains essential contact and payment information, such as the organization's email, phone, account details, and terms & conditions. The layout is responsive to A4 sizing and print-friendly, making it practical for both digital and physical billing.</p>
