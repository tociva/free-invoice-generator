        <h4>Modern Gradient Invoice Template with Decorative Elements</h4><br>

This beautifully crafted invoice template features a modern and vibrant gradient design, ideal for startups, freelancers, and creative agencies seeking a professional yet eye-catching billing document. The layout is clean and well-structured, with vivid header and footer gradients, circular decorative elements, and a responsive design for seamless mobile and desktop viewing.

The top section includes your company logo and name on the left, with a bold "Invoice" title on the right, all set against a stunning blue-to-indigo gradient. The invoice meta area clearly separates customer details and billing information, such as invoice number, date, and due date.

The items table is styled with a warm gradient header (red to yellow), maintaining readability and visual appeal, and supports dynamic placeholders for item name, price, quantity, and total. Totals are shown in a dedicated section with well-aligned and highlighted rows, including subtotal, tax, discount, and the grand total, both numerically and in words.

A thank you footer along with neatly laid out Terms and Notes sections adds a polished and informative touch. The responsive CSS ensures this template adapts perfectly across screen sizes.

With placeholders like [[org_name]], [[item_name]], [[grand_total]], and [[terms_and_conditions]], this template is fully customizable and ready to be integrated with any invoicing system. Its modern styling, decorative gradients, and thoughtful layout make it perfect for branding-conscious businesses that value both form and function.</p>
