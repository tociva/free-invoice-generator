      <p>This bold and modern invoice template features a striking orange-red gradient that infuses energy and professionalism into your billing documents. The top bar creates a strong first impression with its vivid color and balanced layout—combining a prominent logo area on the left and a neatly aligned invoice summary on the right. Designed with clean typography and spacious sections, the template separates organization and customer details into two clear columns, making it easy to scan. The invoice items are presented in a structured table with essential fields such as quantity, unit price, taxes (CGST and SGST), and total, ideal for businesses operating in tax-compliant regions. Financial breakdowns like discounts, subtotal, taxes, and grand total are elegantly arranged in a minimalist summary table, with the grand total emphasized using a vibrant background. A closing “Thank You” message in the same orange accent adds a warm, professional touch. Overall, this template is ideal for companies that want a clean, energetic design with clear sections and tax-specific itemization.</p>
