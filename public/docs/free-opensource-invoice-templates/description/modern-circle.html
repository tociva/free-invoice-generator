      <p>This Modern Invoice Template features a sleek, professional layout designed to meet the needs of Indian businesses, freelancers, service providers, and eCommerce sellers who require GST-compliant invoices with a touch of modern design. The template is built with clear structure, intuitive flow, and aesthetic appeal to ensure smooth client communication and easy record-keeping.

The standout feature is the stylish circular logo section, giving the invoice a bold visual identity from the start. It uses a dual-tone gradient header that separates branding and contact information elegantly. The main content area includes clear, well-aligned sections for billing information, invoice details, and a comprehensive itemized table.

This table supports CGST and SGST columns, essential for businesses registered under Indiaâ€™s Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework. Each row details quantity, price, tax, and total amount, allowing transparent communication of pricing breakdowns. A neatly aligned totals box further displays subtotal, tax, and grand total, ensuring accuracy and clarity.

Additional sections include structured payment method info (PayPal, VISA, MasterCard, cheque) and a signature-ready layout with terms, making it ideal for formal business use. The entire design is responsive and print-ready, suitable for physical mail or digital sharing via PDF.</p>
