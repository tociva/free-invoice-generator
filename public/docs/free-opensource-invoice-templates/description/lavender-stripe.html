      <p>The Invoice template presents a sleek, modern, and highly professional layout ideal for freelancers, agencies, and businesses seeking a clean yet visually distinctive invoice. It is named for its prominent use of deep purple (#5f32d7), which provides a bold accent throughout the documentâ€”used in headings, table headers, and the total due row. This strategic use of color brings a sense of sophistication and consistency while maintaining excellent readability.

At the top, the template features a flexible header that balances branding and invoice metadata. On the left, it allows for the inclusion of your company logo and organization name ([[org_name]]), while the right side presents the invoice title (INVOICE), date ([[invoice_date]]), and invoice number ([[invoice_number]]) in a compact, right-aligned format.

The layout is neatly segmented into logical sections. The info block clearly separates the sender ("From") and recipient ("To") details, using simple font sizes and proper spacing for easy scanning. Each block includes essential contact information such as name, address, email, and phone.

The itemized table is a standout feature of the template. It uses a full-width layout with a deep purple header row and white text for sharp contrast. Items are listed with clearly labeled columns for name, quantity, unit price, and total amount, with monetary values right-aligned for clarity. This setup ensures that both service providers and clients can quickly understand the breakdown of charges.

The summary section aligns to the right and includes subtotals, tax, discount, round-off, and a highlighted total due row. The total row is visually emphasized with a purple background and white text, reinforcing the amount payable. This layout is ideal for both digital viewing and printing.

Supporting notes ([[notes]]) and a friendly "Thank you for your Business" message are included below, contributing to a courteous and professional tone. Finally, the footer adds extra polish with space for terms & conditions, contact information, and a reminder that clients can reach out with any questions.</p>
