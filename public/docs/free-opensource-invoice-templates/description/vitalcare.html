        <h4>Modern Healthcare Invoice Template – Card-Based Clean Design</h4><br>

This modern Healthcare Invoice Template features a professional card-based layout ideal for hospitals, clinics, and wellness centers. Designed with a clean and minimal aesthetic, the template uses a soothing color scheme of teal and mint green, evoking a sense of trust and care—perfectly aligned with healthcare branding.

The layout includes a bold header section with branding and invoice details, followed by responsive “Bill To” and “From” info cards. Services are displayed in individual cards, making each charge easy to understand and visually distinct. Totals are clearly summarized in a highlighted card with soft green tones, reinforcing clarity and readability. The footer provides contact and terms in a simple, user-friendly manner.

Optimized for A4 printing and digital viewing, this HTML/CSS invoice template is fully customizable using dynamic placeholders (e.g., [[customer_name]], [[item_price]], [[grand_total]]), making it a perfect fit for medical billing systems, patient statements, or digital invoices sent via email or PDF.</p>
