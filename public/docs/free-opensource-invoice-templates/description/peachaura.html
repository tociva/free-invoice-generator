      <p>The Modern Invoice Template blends soft, welcoming pastel tones with a clean A4 layout designed for modern businesses, freelancers, and service providers who want a professional and approachable invoicing format. The design features warm gradients of peach and cream, giving it a visually soothing appearance while maintaining business clarity and structure.

At the top, a gradient header with your company logo and "INVOICE" label ensures instant brand recognition. The template offers neatly divided sections for billing information, invoice metadata (like invoice number, issue date, and due date), and a structured itemized table with columns for item name, quantity, unit price, and total.

The totals section is highlighted in soft yellow tones, displaying key calculations like subtotal, discount, round-off, and grand total in a clear, right-aligned format. Finally, a minimalist footer includes contact details, bank information, and payment termsâ€”making it a complete invoicing solution that's also print-ready on standard A4 paper.</p>
