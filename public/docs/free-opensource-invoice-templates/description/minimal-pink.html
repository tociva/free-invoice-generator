      <p>The Healthcare Invoice – Split Screen template features a modern, professional, and visually balanced design, ideal for medical practices, wellness centers, and healthcare-related services. Its unique split-screen layout offers a clean separation of company branding and invoice details, enhancing both aesthetic appeal and readability.

The left section occupies 40% of the page and is styled with a calming teal green (#009688) background—symbolizing health and trust. It contains the company’s logo, name, address, contact details, and invoice metadata like invoice number, date, and due date. This section not only anchors the design visually but also establishes brand identity clearly and prominently.

The right section is the primary workspace where the billing details reside. It begins with the “Bill To” client information, followed by a well-structured itemized table listing the services or products rendered. Each row displays item names, quantities, unit prices, and total amounts in a clean tabular format, with right-aligned numerical columns for better readability.

Below the table, the totals section clearly displays the item total, discount, subtotal, round-off, and finally, the grand total in bold for emphasis. This step-by-step breakdown helps clients easily verify charges and payments due.

At the bottom of the page, the footer includes contact details and a space for terms and conditions, giving clients the information they need to resolve questions or understand service policies.

Overall, this template combines functionality with visual elegance, tailored specifically for the healthcare industry, yet versatile enough for other professional service providers who value clarity, structure, and trust in their billing process.</p>
