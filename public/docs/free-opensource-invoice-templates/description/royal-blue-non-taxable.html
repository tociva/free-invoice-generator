        <h4>Classic Blue Invoice Template with Logo Centerpiece</h4><br>

Presenting a clean and modern invoice template featuring a deep blue theme and a centrally positioned circular logo area â€” perfect for professional branding. Designed with clarity in mind, this template includes all essential invoice elements: company and customer information, invoice number, issue and due dates, and an itemized table for listing products or services.

The layout emphasizes legibility, using a structured grid for item details and a right-aligned totals section for quick financial review. The subtle hover effect on table rows enhances digital readability, while its fully HTML/CSS structure with dynamic placeholders like [[org_name]], [[invoice_number]], and [[grand_total]] makes it ideal for PDF generation, billing software, or SaaS integration.

Perfect for freelancers, consultants, agencies, and businesses seeking a formal yet elegant invoice design.</p>
