      <p>The Mint Invoice template exudes freshness and clarity through its mint-themed color palette and clean design aesthetics. Built for modern businesses, it balances professionalism with visual appeal, making it ideal for startups, freelancers, and creative agencies that want their invoices to feel both trustworthy and stylish.
Design & Layout

The template uses a soft mint green and white color scheme, offering a sense of freshness and calm. The layout is centered within a neatly bordered container, ensuring excellent readability across devices or on print. With smooth shadows and subtle borders, the overall feel is light and non-intrusive.

The template’s structure starts with a header section that includes a company logo and essential invoice metadata, such as the invoice number, issue date, and due date. These are placed side-by-side to save space while remaining prominently visible.
Billing Information

A two-column section labeled "Bill From" and "Bill To" comes next, allowing the sender and recipient information to be displayed in a balanced format. Key placeholders such as [[org_name]], [[customer_name]], [[org_email]], etc., are cleanly styled with line spacing and typography that ensures clear separation between fields.
Itemized Table

The items table is neatly structured with soft background tones for headers (#e9fdf9) and subtle dividers between rows. Columns include:

    Item

    Quantity

    Unit Price

    Total

Text alignment is optimized with all numerical values aligned to the right, which improves readability especially for longer invoices or when printing.
Totals Section

This section appears toward the end and elegantly summarizes the financials, showing:

    Item total

    Discounts applied

    Subtotal

    Tax

    Round off

    Grand Total – emphasized with a larger font and green color (#109f86) to make it stand out

Additionally, the amount in words ([[grand_total_inwords]]) is italicized for formal presentation and added clarity.
Typography & Responsiveness

The template uses "Segoe UI", a modern sans-serif font that enhances legibility. Font sizing and spacing are thoughtfully applied to maintain a clean, readable flow throughout. Although it is designed primarily for PDF generation or A4 viewing, the CSS structure can be easily adjusted for responsiveness on web or mobile platforms.</p>
