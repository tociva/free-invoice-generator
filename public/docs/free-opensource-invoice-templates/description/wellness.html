        <h4>Modern Healthcare Invoice Template – Clean A4 Design with Medical Branding</h4><br>

This Healthcare Invoice Template is a professionally designed A4-format billing solution tailored for medical clinics, hospitals, private practices, and healthcare service providers. With a clean, structured layout and medical-themed color palette, it ensures clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness for patient billing and insurance documentation.

The template features a bold navy blue header (#1f3c88) that highlights your clinic or hospital name ([[org_name]]) alongside your logo ([[logo_small_src]]) and vital invoice metadata including invoice number, issue date, and due date. The header offers a premium healthcare brand appearance, which builds credibility with patients and clients.

The Billing Information Section is neatly divided into “Bill From” and “Bill To” blocks, allowing for clear identification of service provider and patient or insurance details ([[customer_name]], [[customer_address]], etc.). This format is ideal for medical institutions that require precise and structured documentation.

A responsive and print-optimized services table displays all billed items and procedures with placeholders for dynamic data ([[item_name]], [[item_quantity]], [[item_price]], [[item_amount]]). Totals are clearly outlined with breakdowns for subtotal, tax, and grand total ([[grand_total]]), ensuring transparency in medical billing.

The Total Due Section uses a soft green highlight (#d1f2eb) to draw attention to the final amount owed. At the bottom, the layout includes dedicated sections for support contact information ([[org_email]], [[org_phone]]), payment details like account and bank name ([[account_name]], [[bank_name]]), and clear terms and conditions ([[terms_and_conditions]])—vital for insurance claims and legal compliance.

With its print-ready A4 dimensions (210mm x 297mm), hospital-grade aesthetics, and smart use of color and typography, this invoice template is ideal for any medical organization seeking a stylish, functional, and professional invoicing format. Fully customizable and easy to integrate into automated billing systems, it offers everything needed for accurate, patient-friendly invoices.</p>
