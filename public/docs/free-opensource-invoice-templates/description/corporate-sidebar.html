      <p>The Modern Sidebar Invoice template introduces a clean, professional aesthetic with a bold visual contrast, leveraging a deep navy sidebar on the left and a light, content-focused layout on the right. Its layout is structured using modern flexbox techniques, splitting the invoice view into two well-defined sections—sidebar and content—for optimal readability and functional elegance.
Sidebar Design

The left-aligned sidebar serves as a visually striking element, presented in a dark blue (#002b5b) background with white typography for clarity. It prominently features the company logo at the top, followed by essential invoice metadata including the invoice number, issue date, and due date. This section ensures key details are quickly accessible and visually separated from billing or itemization sections.
Content Structure

The main content area is minimalist and highly legible. It begins with billing details, organized into a two-column layout: one for the issuing company and another for the recipient. This is followed by an itemized table listing products or services, each with columns for Item, Quantity, Unit Price, and Total. The table styling employs soft background highlights and borders, offering clear row separation without overwhelming the viewer.
Financial Summary

Beneath the item table, a totals section calculates and displays comprehensive invoice amounts, including item total, discounts, subtotal, tax, round off, and the final grand total. The Grand Total is emphasized with a larger font size and bold styling in the brand’s signature blue, while a lighter note renders the amount in words—ideal for legal or formal clarity.
Responsive & Print-Ready

While this invoice is designed primarily for PDF export or printing, the use of flexible widths, spacing, and scalable fonts ensures it remains visually stable across various screen sizes. Its style choices make it ideal for modern SaaS platforms, accounting tools, or B2B invoicing applications.</p>
