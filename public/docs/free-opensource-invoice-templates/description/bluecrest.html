      <p>The Template presents a modern and professional design with a clear and intuitive structure, ideal for tech-savvy businesses and service providers. It uses a balanced color palette of soft gray and blue, with accents of deep navy for headings and highlights, delivering both aesthetic appeal and readability. The layout is centered around a white content box with subtle shadows and borders that help the invoice stand out from the light gray background.

At the top of the invoice, a horizontal banner includes a small company logo, followed by a clear header displaying the business name and invoice title. The layout then splits into two panels—one side contains detailed billing information for the customer (including name, phone, email, and address), while the other side features a highlighted box showing the invoice date, due date, and invoice number. This division ensures that vital metadata is easily accessible at a glance.

The itemized billing table is thoughtfully styled, with blue table headers and alternating light rows. Each row includes fields for the item name, quantity, unit price, CGST, SGST, and total amount. Below the table, a summary section neatly lists out the item total, applied discount, subtotal, tax amount, and rounding adjustment. The grand total is prominently displayed in a bold colored box, drawing attention to the amount due.

Toward the bottom, the template provides clear instructions for payment, including account number, SWIFT code, and PayPal email, making it easy for clients to initiate payment. The invoice concludes with a space for a company signature and footer information, including the company’s contact details. Altogether, the Codeso template strikes a balance between form and function, making it an excellent choice for digital agencies, freelancers, or businesses that value clean design with a professional tone.</p>
