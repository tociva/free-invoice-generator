      <p>The Green Accent Invoice Template features a clean and modern design with a calming green theme that promotes professionalism and readability. Built with soft tones of emerald and mint, it’s ideal for businesses looking to present their brand as trustworthy, eco-conscious, or health-oriented.

The top header showcases a bold green background with a large "INVOICE" title and logo, making a strong first impression. Below it, the invoice is organized into three clear sections: sender details, recipient details, and invoice metadata (number, date, due date).

The itemized table stands out with its alternating row background and well-spaced columns for quantity, unit price, taxes (CGST and SGST), and total. All numeric columns are right-aligned for easy scanning and professional formatting.

The totals section clearly lists each cost component — including discounts, subtotal, taxes, and rounding — culminating in a highlighted Total row, styled for emphasis.

The footer includes payment details and a signature area, reinforcing credibility and encouraging prompt payment. It is responsive and adapts beautifully to smaller screens, making it suitable for both print and digital delivery.

This template is perfect for small businesses, freelancers, or service providers seeking a minimal yet branded invoice design with built-in tax structure support and clear hierarchy.</p>
