        <h4>Modern Blue-Themed Invoice Template with Clean Layout</h4><br>

This professionally designed modern blue-themed invoice template offers a fresh and corporate look, ideal for businesses aiming to present a clean and trustworthy image. The use of the Montserrat font, rounded logo container, and a calming blue primary color ensures that the layout is both visually appealing and easy to read.

The template begins with a bold header that includes the company logo and name on the left and essential invoice details (number, date, and due date) on the right, allowing for a quick scan of crucial information. It also provides a well-structured billing section that clearly lists the customer's name, address, and contact details.

A standout feature is the zebra-striped itemized table, which improves readability by alternating row colors and aligning financial data to the right for clarity. It supports key placeholders like [[item_name]], [[item_quantity]], [[item_price]], [[item_cgst]], [[item_sgst]], and [[item_amount]], ensuring all invoice details are dynamically rendered.

At the bottom, a summary section highlights financial totals such as the item total, discount, subtotal, taxes, round-off value, and final grand total. The clean typography and spacing make the totals visually distinguishable without cluttering the layout.

The template finishes with a contact footer and a polite thank-you message, reinforcing professionalism and customer appreciation.

This template is ideal for freelancers, agencies, and modern companies looking to deliver branded, digital-friendly invoices that are both elegant and functional. It's fully customizable with placeholder support, responsive design for various screen sizes, and perfect for printing or PDF export.</p>
