        <h4>Warm Gradient Invoice Template – Elegant A4 Design for Professional Billing</h4><br>

This Warm Gradient Invoice Template blends aesthetics with functionality, delivering a polished and modern design suited for businesses, freelancers, and agencies. Designed in A4 dimensions for easy printing, the template features a clean white background subtly enhanced with a radial gradient in warm yellow-orange hues (#fdcb6e and #e17055), evoking a vibrant yet professional look.

At the top, the layout includes a clearly defined logo section with dynamic support for custom branding using [[logo_small_src]], followed by prominent company information ([[org_name]]) and a pill-shaped "INVOICE" title for instant recognition. Below, the project name and notes section ([[notes]]) add clarity to the invoice’s purpose.

The billing section is thoughtfully divided, with recipient details ([[customer_name]], [[customer_address]], etc.) on the left and invoice-specific metadata like number, date, due date, and account info ([[invoice_number]], [[invoice_date]], [[account_number]], etc.) on the right, all styled with soft typography and spacing for enhanced legibility.

The central itemized table uses a soft-shadowed card-like layout with vibrant gradient headers and a minimalist row design. It supports dynamic insertion of line items with placeholders for description, quantity, price, and total ([[item_name]], [[item_quantity]], [[item_price]], [[item_amount]]), ensuring full adaptability across different invoicing platforms.

The summary section neatly displays subtotal, discount, tax, round-off, and the grand total ([[grand_total]]) using clear hierarchy and spacing. A friendly icon adds visual balance and character. The amount in words ([[grand_total_inwords]]) is also included for legal and banking clarity.

At the bottom, the Bank Details, Notes, and Terms & Conditions are presented in separate blocks, making it easy for clients to understand payment and policy terms. Finally, the contact information and a signature section ([[org_authority_name]], [[org_authority_designation]]) ensure the document feels official and complete.

Ideal for any brand seeking a polished, visually appealing invoice design that communicates trust and clarity, this template is easy to integrate and style while remaining fully print-ready.</p>
