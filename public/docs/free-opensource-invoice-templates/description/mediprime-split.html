      <p>The Healthcare Invoice – Split Screen template features a clean, modern split-layout design ideal for hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and other healthcare service providers. Its visually distinct left and right sections offer clarity, structure, and a professional look suitable for both digital and printed formats.

The left panel, shaded in a calming teal green (#009688), serves as a brand and summary area. It prominently displays the organization's logo, name, contact details, and a quick overview of the invoice information such as invoice number, date, and payment due date. This color-blocked area enhances visual hierarchy and gives the template a strong, recognizable identity.

The right panel is where the transaction details reside. It starts with a clearly formatted Bill To section for client information, followed by a structured itemized table showing service or product names, quantities, unit prices, and total amounts. The right alignment of numeric values improves readability and ensures a neat financial summary.

Below the table, a totals block concisely presents item total, discount, subtotal, round-off, and the grand total, which is highlighted for emphasis. The template concludes with a minimalist footer containing contact support info and terms and conditions, ensuring all necessary information is accessible at a glance.

The split-screen layout makes it easy to differentiate between branding and billing information, and the color palette evokes trust and cleanliness—qualities that align well with the healthcare industry. This template is ideal for businesses that want a professional, user-friendly, and health-conscious invoice design.</p>
