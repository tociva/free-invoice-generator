      <p>The Clean Classic Invoice Template delivers a timeless and professional look with a straightforward layout that prioritizes clarity and structure. Built using a soft grey color palette and generous spacing, it is ideal for businesses that value simplicity and reliability in documentation.

The top of the invoice features a dual-column header showcasing your company logo and invoice details such as invoice number and date. Below, the Bill From and Bill To sections are neatly aligned side by side, giving immediate context about the transaction parties.

The itemized table provides a clear breakdown of products or services, quantities, unit pricing, and total cost â€” all aligned for easy reading. A bold total summary at the bottom ensures the grand total is easily visible to clients, reducing confusion and promoting quicker payments.

With clean lines, modern typography (Segoe UI), and a layout optimized for both digital and printed formats, this template is a perfect choice for freelancers, consultants, and small businesses seeking a polished yet simple invoice format.</p>
