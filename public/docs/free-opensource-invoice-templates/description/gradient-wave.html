      <p>The Gradient Wave Invoice Template offers a dynamic and visually captivating design that blends modern aesthetics with practical layout. The vibrant header features a bold purple-to-blue gradient with a custom SVG wave, creating a striking visual separation that instantly draws attention. A circular logo overlay in the corner adds a stylish touch of branding.

Inside, the layout is clean and well-structured. Key billing details like invoice number, dates, and addresses are neatly separated into sections for clear readability. The itemized billing table uses a subtle design with a colored header and clean rows to present financial data professionally.

The totals section provides a detailed financial summary, including discounts, taxes, round-offs, and the grand total â€” both in numerals and words. The footer includes space for notes, payment terms, bank details, and an authorized signature, making it a complete, ready-to-use solution.

This template is ideal for businesses that want to present invoices with a modern edge while maintaining full functionality and clarity. Suitable for freelancers, agencies, or tech-forward companies, it balances creative flair with professional structure.</p>
