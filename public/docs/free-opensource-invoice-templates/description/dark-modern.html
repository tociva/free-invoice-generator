      <p>This Dark Modern Invoice Template combines a sleek, high-contrast aesthetic with practical business functionality, making it ideal for creative agencies, tech startups, and professionals who want a bold, stylish look. The design features a dark theme background (#1c1c1c and #2b2b2b) contrasted with light text for excellent readability. It uses soft, warm gradient accents in shades of sunset orange and coral (#ff7e5f to #feb47b) for headers and highlights, offering a striking yet professional visual impression.

The header section sits within a beautiful gradient block and includes the organization’s name, address, contact details, and logo. The layout is split between left-aligned business identity and right-aligned branding, creating balance and structure. Below this, a dedicated invoice metadata section presents the invoice number, issue date, and due date against a mid-tone dark background, making key information stand out.

The billing section follows next, clearly labeled "Bill To," and includes all customer contact information. These structured blocks maintain strong typographic hierarchy with colored headings and muted content, ensuring clarity.

The main item table is laid out with ample spacing and neat borders, keeping it easy to read even with a large number of line items. Each row displays the item name, quantity, unit price, and total amount, using right-aligned currency formatting for financial clarity. The table head uses a slightly lighter background to distinguish itself from data rows.

A detailed totals section is included at the bottom right, providing a breakdown of item total, discount, subtotal, round-off, and the final grand total. The final total is styled with bold typography and orange color highlights to emphasize its importance. Additionally, the total in words ([[grand_total_inwords]]) is displayed in an enlarged, italicized format, adding a layer of clarity and professionalism for accounting or legal purposes.

The notes section is visually distinguished by an orange border and light text, suitable for including extra instructions, disclaimers, or personal messages. Below that, the authorization block includes placeholders for the responsible party’s name and designation, adding credibility and finality to the document.

Finally, the footer consolidates payment details such as the bank name, account number, and account holder's name, followed by terms and conditions, ensuring the invoice is both legally comprehensive and payment-ready. With its refined use of spacing, color, and font weight, this template strikes the perfect balance between modern design sensibility and invoice functionality, all while being easily customizable through placeholders like [[customer_name]], [[item_price]], [[notes]], and more.</p>
