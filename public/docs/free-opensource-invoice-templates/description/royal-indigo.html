        <h4>Indigo Invoice Template – Bold Sidebar Layout with Modern Styling</h4><br>

The Indigo Invoice Template offers a visually distinct and professional billing layout featuring a striking purple sidebar paired with a clean, spacious content area. Ideal for modern businesses, agencies, and freelancers, this template balances functionality with elegant design. The left sidebar highlights the company logo, invoice number, issue date, and payment due date—making essential details instantly accessible.

The main content area is designed for clarity, presenting "From" and "To" billing details side by side, followed by a neatly structured itemized table with quantity, unit price, and totals. The bottom section summarizes financials with subtotal, discount, tax, round-off, and grand total—all clearly formatted for easy review. There's also a field for the amount in words for added clarity and compliance.

With customizable placeholders like [[org_name]], [[item_name]], and [[grand_total]], this responsive HTML/CSS template is perfect for dynamic invoice generation, PDF export, or integration into invoice software systems.</p>
