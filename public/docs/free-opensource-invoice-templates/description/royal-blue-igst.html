        <h4>Deep Blue Minimalist Invoice Template</h4><br>

This clean and professional invoice template is designed for businesses and freelancers who value clarity, structure, and branding. Featuring a bold “INVOICE” heading and a circular logo placement in a deep navy blue (#1e3a8a) theme, it creates a strong first impression while maintaining elegance and readability. The layout includes distinct sections for sender and recipient information, invoice metadata (number, date, due date), and a well-organized itemized table supporting IGST-based tax breakdown.

Its hover-highlight table rows improve user interaction when viewed digitally, while the structured totals summary allows for quick financial overview. Built entirely in HTML and CSS with dynamic placeholders like [[org_name]], [[customer_name]], [[item_amount]], and [[grand_total]], it’s ideal for integration into automated billing systems, PDF generation tools, and SaaS platforms.

This responsive and print-friendly invoice template suits startups, agencies, and enterprise billing teams looking for a no-frills yet aesthetically sharp solution. Compatible with any web browser and easy to customize for branding.</p>
