        <h4>Classic Newspaper-Style A4 Invoice Template – Print-Ready and Professional</h4><br>

This A4-sized HTML invoice template is designed with a timeless newspaper-style aesthetic, perfect for businesses seeking a clean, authoritative, and print-friendly layout. Featuring a serif typeface, bold black borders, and a monochrome color palette, the template emulates a professional publication look—ideal for formal client billing, accounting firms, or traditional service providers.

The top header section includes a prominent business logo and a large “INVOICE” title in elegant, uppercase typography. Below it, the layout is neatly divided into "Bill From" and "Bill To" columns, presenting sender and client details side-by-side. A second row highlights invoice-specific metadata like invoice number, date, and due date, along with banking details for seamless payment processing.

The itemized table section is fully structured for clarity, showing description, quantity, unit price, and total cost. Each row is bordered and spaced evenly for maximum legibility, even in black-and-white print. The summary section underneath includes item total, discount, subtotal, round-off, and a bold “Grand Total” field for final payment clarity.

A classic footer finishes the design with italicized contact details and a brief thank-you note—providing both closure and professionalism.

This template is optimized for A4 paper size, making it ideal for PDF export or direct printing. It balances visual hierarchy and typographic finesse, appealing to businesses that value structure, legibility, and a refined, editorial style.</p>
