      <p>The Invoice template features a clean, professional layout with a bold purple accent that runs throughout key elements such as section headers, table headers, and the total row. At the top, the header area displays the company logo and name on the left and invoice details—such as the invoice number and date—on the right. The sender ("From") and recipient ("To") sections are laid out side-by-side for clarity, providing contact details including address, email, and phone number. The central section of the template includes a structured table that lists all invoiced items with columns for item name, quantity, unit price, and total amount. The financial summary is presented in a compact, right-aligned summary box, displaying subtotal, tax, discount, round-off, and the final total due—highlighted with a purple background to draw attention. Additional elements like a notes section, a thank-you message, and a well-organized footer with contact details and terms & conditions complete the design. This template is ideal for businesses and freelancers who want to convey a professional and stylish image while keeping the invoice easy to read.</p>
