      <p>The Invoice Template is a fresh, vibrant, and eco-themed design that emphasizes clarity, professionalism, and sustainability. With a soft mint-green background (#e6f7f2) and crisp white content area, this template projects cleanliness and modernity while maintaining warmth. It features rounded corners, shadows, and ample spacing that lend a soft, welcoming appearance, ideal for businesses that value approachability and trust—such as eco-products, health services, wellness brands, and startups.

At the top, the header stands out with a cheerful light aqua background (#d8fff3) and bold red title text (#e13b3b), which draws immediate attention to the brand. The company logo is displayed prominently above the company name [[org_name]], followed by a horizontal strip of metadata containing the invoice number, invoice date, and due date, arranged neatly in a horizontal flex layout. This presentation ensures that essential invoice details are immediately accessible without clutter.

Below the header, the info section is elegantly split into two blocks. On the left, it showcases the customer’s contact information, including name, phone, email, and address. On the right, it provides payment method details, such as the bank name and account number, making it practical and actionable for the client. Both blocks are styled with a subtle green-tinted background (#f7fffb) and rounded edges for consistency with the template’s theme.

The items table is structured with clarity in mind. Each row displays the item name, quantity, unit price, and total amount, with headings placed in a soft teal background (#6edfc4) and white font for contrast. Right-aligned numerical columns help with visual scanning and emphasize the monetary figures. Alternating rows and padding create a clean flow that ensures readability, even with long item lists.

In the terms section, terms and conditions are presented in a straightforward paragraph format beneath the table, framed by generous margins and line spacing. This allows for inclusion of disclaimers, legal text, or service-related notes without overwhelming the document.

The summary section, located at the bottom right, aggregates the key financial figures in order—Item Total, Discount, Tax, Round Off, and Sub-Total—culminating in a prominent Total amount. The total is highlighted in a larger, bold font inside a teal-colored rounded label (#6edfc4), drawing attention while staying consistent with the overall palette. A line displaying the amount in words just beneath adds both clarity and formality to the summary.

The footer contains the organization's address, email, and phone number, neatly boxed into a compact section. The template finishes with a "THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS" note in bold teal (#009688) text, conveying appreciation and reinforcing a professional yet friendly brand image.

Overall, this Green Invoice Template balances modern design with subtle branding cues, making it perfect for service-based businesses and companies aiming to project a clean, honest, and environmentally conscious brand identity. Its use of clearly labeled placeholders like [[item_price]], [[grand_total]], and [[customer_email]] ensures seamless integration with invoice automation systems.</p>
