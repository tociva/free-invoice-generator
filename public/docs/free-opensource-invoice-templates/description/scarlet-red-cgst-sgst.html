        <h4>Elegant Red Accent Invoice Template – Clean, Corporate & GST-Ready Design</h4><br>

This elegant red-accented invoice template offers a perfect balance of professionalism and readability, making it ideal for businesses that value both aesthetics and clarity in their billing documents. The dominant crimson theme (#b22222) is used strategically to highlight important headers and totals without overwhelming the content, creating a clean and visually structured experience.

At the top, the template showcases your organization name in a bold heading, immediately followed by a centered circular logo area that reinforces branding. The customer billing details and invoice metadata (number, date, due date) are presented clearly with spacious alignment, ensuring easy scanning for clients.

The itemized table is the heart of the layout, using a red-highlighted header row to distinguish column titles like Quantity, Price per Unit, CGST, SGST, and Amount. With responsive alignment and zebra-striping on hover, the table offers excellent readability, especially useful for GST-compliant invoices in India or similar tax systems.

The totals section is aligned to the right and includes Subtotal, Tax, and a bold TOTAL row, allowing for quick financial overviews. Although the Terms & Conditions section is optional (currently commented out), it can be easily activated to provide important payment policies or legal disclaimers.

The footer wraps the design with a bold red background and displays your organization’s contact details in a centered, formal tone—maintaining brand consistency and offering a visually satisfying close to the document.

With placeholder tags like [[item_name]], [[item_cgst]], [[grand_total]], and [[org_email]], this template integrates seamlessly with automated invoice generation systems. Its print-friendly and mobile-friendly layout makes it suitable for a wide range of industries—from retail and services to SaaS and logistics.</p>
