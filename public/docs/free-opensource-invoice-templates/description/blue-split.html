      <p>The Sidebar Invoice Template is a modern, clean, and visually striking invoice layout designed for professionals and businesses that want to make a bold yet organized impression. The template features a two-column structure, with a distinctive left-hand sidebar highlighted by a blue gradient background that draws attention to the recipient's billing information. This sidebar layout not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also helps separate key customer details from the main invoice body, improving readability.

On the right side, the main content area presents the company’s logo and name, invoice number, and issue date at the top, followed by a detailed itemized table listing product or service names, quantities, unit prices, tax breakdowns (CGST and SGST), and the total for each line item. Below the table, the template neatly summarizes the billing amounts—showing item total, discounts, tax, rounding adjustments, and the grand total—in a clear, right-aligned block that emphasizes accuracy and transparency.

The footer area includes a section for payment information, such as account number and bank details, along with a space for an authorized signature and a polite thank-you message. The clean typography, structured layout, and soft color palette make this template suitable for creative agencies, modern firms, freelancers, and any business that wants to communicate professionalism and clarity in their billing documents.</p>
