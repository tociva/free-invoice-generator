        <h4>Modern Pink Accent Invoice Template â€“ Professional & Stylish Billing Design</h4><br>

This elegant HTML invoice template features a modern pink-accented color scheme using #c2185b as the primary highlight, paired with a clean, minimalist white layout. Designed with a contemporary aesthetic, this template is ideal for creative agencies, freelancers, startups, boutiques, and service-based businesses that want to leave a lasting impression on clients. The use of Google Fonts (Lato) ensures high readability and modern typography across devices.

The template is fully responsive and mobile-friendly, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes. Its layout is structured into clear sections including business and client information, invoice metadata, itemized billing, and a concise total summary. Each section is visually separated for clarity, and the totals block uses a subtle pink background to emphasize key figures like subtotal, tax, and grand total. The invoice includes placeholders for variables such as [[org_name]], [[customer_name]], [[item_price]], and [[grand_total]], allowing dynamic population via backend systems or template engines.

Optimized for print and digital delivery, this invoice template is perfect for any brand looking to present invoices with professionalism and personality. Its lightweight, semantic HTML structure also supports easy integration into invoice generation systems, email templates, or web-based dashboards.</p>
