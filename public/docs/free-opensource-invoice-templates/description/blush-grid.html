      <p>The Template is a clean, modern, and stylishly structured invoice design ideal for creative professionals, freelancers, and businesses that prioritize simplicity and functionality. Featuring a side-by-side layout, the template is visually divided into two main sections: a light-gray left sidebar and a spacious right main content area. The sidebar includes clearly grouped contact details for both the billing recipient ("Bill To") and the sender ("From"), along with a placeholder for a company logo at the top, all presented in an easy-to-read font and clean vertical alignment. The use of the soft gray background and pinkish-red highlight color (#f57280) gives the sidebar a distinct identity without overwhelming the main content.

On the right, the white-background main panel contains a bold "INVOICE" heading centered at the top, immediately followed by a horizontal metadata section highlighting invoice number, issue date, and due date. Below that, a well-structured table organizes item details in six columns: Item, Quantity, Unit Price, CGST, SGST, and Total. The table layout is clear, with the primary color used in header rows and soft alternating row backgrounds to improve readability. It uses token placeholders such as [[item_name]] and [[item_amount]] to support dynamic data population.

At the bottom of the invoice, a summary totals section provides a neat breakdown of all billing figures, including item total, discount, subtotal, tax amount, rounding adjustment, and the final grand total. This section is aligned to the right to draw attention and facilitate quick scanning. Finally, the footer expresses gratitude for the client's business and includes a space for an authorized signature, giving the document a professional close. Fully responsive and mobile-friendly, Template is well-suited for both print and digital invoice distribution.</p>
