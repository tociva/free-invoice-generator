      <p>The Invoice Template is a visually striking, modern design that blends professionalism with flair — perfect for creative businesses, agencies, or startups aiming to impress clients with a memorable invoice. This A4-sized layout uses a calming wave-inspired header in a gradient of aqua blues (#00b4db to #0083b0) to convey creativity and trust. The top section prominently features a circular logo placeholder, company name, address, contact info, and invoice metadata, all centered and framed by a fluid aesthetic.

Below the header, the layout splits into two responsive info boxes — one for billing details and another for payment information. These boxes are styled with light blue backgrounds and rounded edges, offering a clear separation of content without visual clutter. Each field is clearly labeled for easy reading.

The itemized section includes a well-organized table with alternating row highlights and a dark blue header for excellent contrast and legibility. It supports dynamic rows between [[items_start]] and [[items_end]] for flexibility in listing invoice items. The numeric values are structured to maintain clean alignment, ensuring your client can easily understand pricing.

A soft-toned totals summary box follows the table, showing line-by-line calculations including item total, discounts, taxes, and the grand total — which is emphasized in bold and a larger font for clarity. The amount in words appears below, italicized for professional detailing.

Finally, the footer uses the same elegant blue tones from the header and is divided into three content-rich columns: Terms & Conditions, Notes, and Authorized By — each highlighted by subtle white transparency for separation. This helps establish legal clarity, add any remarks, and confirm the invoice's authenticity with a designated authority.
